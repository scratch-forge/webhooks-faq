## Create An App

### Steps

* Go to Autodesk [Forge Platform](https://developer.autodesk.com/) and [Sign In](https://accounts.autodesk.com/Authentication/LogOn)
* Go back to [Forge Platform](https://developer.autodesk.com/) after Sign In if it is not redirected automatically
* Create a Forge App using [Create App](https://developer.autodesk.com/myapps)
![Create App 1](../image/1.png)
  * If you want to access Webhooks API, don't forget to select **Webhook API** (and, Data Management API since you will be listening to events coming from file/folder/project operations)
![Create App 2](../image/2.png)
  * Provide a `App Name` such as `Webhooks-TestApp` for your Forge App
  * Provide App description (Optional)
  * Set a `Callback URL`. This Callback URL is used for [3-legged](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/tutorials/get-3-legged-token/) Authentication fLow. And, this callback URL is different from Webhooks callback URL we will be registering later.
  * If you have already a working server which can receive 3-legged Authentication Token then you can move onto the next step. You can setup  [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) test server if you dont have a server ready yet. Please see **Setup ngrok server for Callback URL** section for detailed steps.
  * Provide callback URL in `Callback URL` field. If you are using ngrok, copy and paste the `Forwarding` URL

  * Please leave `Your Website URL` empty for this example since its an optional field.
  * Click on **CREATE APP**. Just now, you successfully created a Forge App.
  * You will notice `Client ID` and `Client Secret` for your App. We will use it later for accessing Webhooks and other Forge APIs.
