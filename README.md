## Forge Webhooks FAQ

Information on Autodesk Forge Webhooks. Official documentation is [here](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/webhooks/v1)


### What is Webhook?

In simplest language, it is a way to communicate to other application when an event occurs.

Let's take a real life example: Imagine that you're interested in reading book of _Science fiction_ genre. These books are available in your nearest library. You want to read the new book in _Science fiction_ genre as soon as it becomes available in library.

Here are your options:

1. *Polling*: You need to visit library frequently to find out if there is any new book in _Science fiction_ genre. This option definitely doesn't sound interesting. Certainly wastage of effort and time for you and librarian.

2. *Webhooks*: You provide your phone number (or, Callback URL) and, register your interest in _Science fiction_ genre (or, event of interest) with Library administrator (or, Forge Webhooks service). So that, when a new book arrives in genre of your interest, you can get notification on your phone (event information on Callback). After receiving the event, you can take action such as visit the library to borrow the book.


### What are the scenarios where I should use Webhooks?

* If your application is polling Forge Data Management APIs regularly and frequently to determine if there are any changes in Files or Folders.
* If you want to determine if a file/folder is added, deleted, modified, or renamed.

To detect such changes, you must use Webhooks.
